# 6to5 (very wip)

Convert ES6+ into ES5.1. For many scripts it's extremely slow and can fill up the RAM. Might still be interesting to test some stuff.

Usage example:

```
ES6TO5_CACHE=/tmp/6to5_cache cat test.js | 6to5
```

Even more experimental:

```
ES6TO5_FAST=YES cat test.js | 6to5
```

Regenerator is needed though for runtime:
